# 🌍 Travel Recommendation Website

🔗 **Live Demo:** [View Project on GitHub Pages](https://hikko218.github.io/Travel_Homepage/)  

A responsive web application that helps users discover travel destinations by city, country, or category (e.g., beach, temple). The project demonstrates dynamic data rendering, interactive search functionality, and a clean user interface using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## ✨ Features

  Travel recommendations are loaded dynamically from a local JSON file.

- 🧠 **Input Normalization**  
  Case-insensitive and whitespace-tolerant search for better UX.

- 🖼️ **Responsive Layout**  
  Flexbox-based layout with styled sidebar, header, and footer.

- 📸 **Dynamic DOM Rendering**  
  Results are generated and inserted into the DOM with JavaScript.

- 🎨 **Styled Background**  
  Full-screen image with `background-size: cover` and centered content.

- 💬 **Popup Interaction**  
  Simple confirmation popup when the "Visit" button is clicked.
